# ProofLoop Goal Ledger Receipt

Generated: 2026-07-08T07:17:30.519Z

This committed receipt summarizes local `.proofloop/goals` process state. Raw `.proofloop` stores stay gitignored; blocker reasons, resume commands, and evidence paths are copied here so blocked claims survive local disk cleanup.

JSON receipt: `docs/eval/proofloop-goal-ledger.json`

### Blocked Reasons

| Task | Status | Reason | Evidence | Resume |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| spreadsheetbench-v1-full-official-score | pending | Full public 912-task SpreadsheetBench V1 bundle is staged and deterministically scored: 912/912 tasks, 2,729 agent-visible workbooks, 2,729 evaluator answer workbooks, 95/912 copy-input baseline pass. | docs/eval/official-benchmark-task-coverage.json<br>docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-v1-912-stage.json<br>docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-v1-912-copy-input-baseline.json | run all 912 SpreadsheetBench V1 tasks through the model runner, use npm run benchmark:proofloop:harness-economics to select cheap proxy routes for product iteration, then npm run benchmark:official:task-coverage -- --strict |
| spreadsheetbench-v1-full-official-score | pending | All 912 tasks need model-run evidence before strict official-score promotion; cheaper OpenRouter proxy judges can triage product quality but cannot replace the SpreadsheetBench workbook scorer for the official claim. | docs/eval/official-benchmark-task-coverage.json<br>docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-v1-912-stage.json<br>docs/eval/spreadsheetbench-v1-912-copy-input-baseline.json | run all 912 SpreadsheetBench V1 tasks through the model runner, use npm run benchmark:proofloop:harness-economics to select cheap proxy routes for product iteration, then npm run benchmark:official:task-coverage -- --strict |

## Goal: voice-agent-implementation

- Status: passed
- Objective: Implement the Room OS capability-donor voice layer in NodeRoom, including chat-composer mic, authenticated provider STT/TTS fallback, and no direct durable voice mutations; prove it with deterministic voice tests, UI tests, provider boundary tests, Convex analyzer dry-run, architecture budget, NodeAgent smokes, and proofloop doctor.
